//When?
//when we need only a single instance of a class as a single source of truht
//we dont want to do eager initialization, only lazy initialization
//why is it a bad idea to have a static variable instead?
// 1. Static variable: Gets initialized when the class is first loaded â€” you have little control over when that happens.
//2 . Static variables are globally available and often globally mutable.
